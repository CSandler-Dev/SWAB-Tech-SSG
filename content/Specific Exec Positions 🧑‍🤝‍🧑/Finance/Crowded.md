#### Main Issues with SWAB Banking:
- Unable to easily switch between officers year to year
- The ability to spend 60-90k in one day
- The ability to track & understand our financials

> [!important] Regions doesn’t fully integrate well with our specialized needs and there needs to be some form of solution

	- 5k collective limit daily
- Expense Cards
	- IMPORTANT FEATURE
	- Allows us to make unlimited expense accounts (with digital only or physical/digital cards)
		- One expense card per contact
		- Dir. Finance has COMPLETE CONTROL of how much money is put into the account
> [!question] Why Expense Cards?
> Could vastly simplify reimbursements & spending during the year then, the cards used by each position throughout the year can be all given to the Dir. Finance for Event Day...that way we have enough of a limit on the cards.

I spoke to a representative from Crowded so I can explain expense cards and how we could use them a little better. They also told me we can have daily rate increases if we ask in advance for Event Day ⬆️

#### Big Benefits
- The ability to have multiple TRACKABLE and CONTROLLABLE expense cards in either digital or physical form
	- Would solve the Walmart problem
- The tools provide a lot of good financial metrics to the Dir. of Finance on web & mobile
- Easy for exec leadership changes because its online
- FDIC insured up to $250k as well
#### Risks
- More cards means more to worry about?
	- Yes and no. The expense cards are more like gift cards...the Dir Finance adds or subtracts funds from their account. They can't spend outside of that
- Hard to switch funds over?
	- Crowded uses Plaid which connects with Regions. It establishes a secure connection and we can transfer money to and from Crowded
		- We can fully switch over or just use it as a way to pay on Event Day, its up to SWAB
- Can we loose SWAB's money?
	- Crowded is not a bank, the banks they work with are the ones who actually hold our money and they are FDIC insured
	- Visa handles all of the fraud across cards
