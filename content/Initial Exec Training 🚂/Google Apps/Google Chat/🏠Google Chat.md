>Chat is SWAB's information and communication hub. In this app, we utilize [[Spaces]] and [[Direct Messages]] to communicate outside of meetings, share [[Google Drive]] files, and utilize Google Meet to have quick meetings and check-ins across the week.

> [!warning]  IMPORTANT 
This app is very important during the year. We really need to stick to it for SWAB "business" and everyone needs to be really comfortable using it on the reg. Madden will be sending things out and we will all be communicating on it so please look into this guide as a start to becoming comfortable.
