#### Google Workspace (SWORKSPACE)

Overview:
- SWAB utilizes a *Google Workspace* for non profits to run our internal emails
	- Free to nonprofits
	- Allows us to have @swabuga.org emails
	- Gives us access to more features than regular @gmail.com
	- Is safer
	- Gives us a more *professional* vibe
- This "SWorkspace" is a very powerful tool that can help you do your SWAB work better so, I created this
	- Play around with the site and get comfortable with how to navigate it! 


> [!info] IMPORTANT
> The MOST IMPORTANT apps for you to really become comfortable with are ==Google Chat== and ==Google Drive==
> Please take some good time looking through them!
